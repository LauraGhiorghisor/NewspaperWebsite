        <div class="intro">
            <p>
                The two most common roles for a web developer are those of front-end and back-end developer,
                respectively.
                Front-end refers mostly to user interface design and requries knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Back-end refers to server-side scripting and functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The developers who do both are called full-stack developers, but that position is usually common in
                smaller
                businesses, with a limited degree of specialisation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following are two extracts from real life job descriptions for these two positions.

                        <p>A front end developer/engineer is in charge of managing complex details about projects that
                            require
                            analyzing design requirements, as well as recommending technical solutions to make projects
                            scalable,
                            maintainable, and efficient.

                            They also debug websites to fix mistakes in
                            the code to make sure they are error-free for network administrators and end users. A front
                            end developer/engineer needs to handle stress well and be a great team player, as they will
                            normally
                            work many hours and in team settings to ensure all hardware and software works properly.
                            Their main tools involve a personal computer, and popular software such as a word processor
                            or notepad,
                            programming language editors, and different browser setups to check website errors across
                            platforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            They may work in an office with other professionals in similar positions, such as software
                            developers or
                            web designers, or they may work from home. They report to the organization's IT manager.
                            Besides analyzing
                            code and debugging applications, they also should have working knowledge of several
                            programming languages
                            and able to adapt to new versions of software.
                        </p>
                        <p> They also should be proficient in using Office applications,
                            and have advanced knowledge in databases and networks. In addition, a bachelor's degree in
                            information technology
                            is needed to become a front end developer/engineer. Additional certifications such as the
                            SUN, IBM, Microsoft,
                            and Oracle developer certifications can provide advantages over other applicants.

                            as they are responsible for programming and maintaining the company's website and all its
                            components. They also coordinate the pages, forms, functions, databases, and web servers
                            and must be familiar with server side languages such as PHP, Ruby, and Python, and
                            relational databases like SQL data type or non-relational as MongoDB. Back-end
                            developers/engineers must also be able to implement JavaScript handles on the side of the
                            browser as a bridge between the interface and development engine, often by using a
                            framework like Zend or Cake, or a CMS like WordPress or Drupal.

                        <p>
                            Back-end developers/engineers should have a range of technical skills and basic knowledge

                            technical platforms. They must be proactive and constantly study different coding
                            languages, such as PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript to stay up-to-date while being able to
                            work under pressure, as they are the last link in the chain and must face all problems from
                            the preceding development stages and find creative and flexible solutions.

                        <p>
                            Back-end developers/engineers must work well in teams in order to understand and contribute
                            during the early development stages, and should also feel comfortable working alone and
                            spending most of their time at a computer in an office, though some interaction with team
                            members and customers is necessary in this position.

        <p>
            Depending on personal inclindation, a soon-to-be developer can choose either as a career. Both require soft
            skills, in an industry
            where technology is meant to come and enhance the human circumstances that it is applied to and integrated
            in. In terms of
            development, the team effort cannot be overstated, as it is paramount to a successful product delivery.

            <p> The knowledge requuired for a successful job application can vary depending on the level advertised.
                The rule of thumb is that the core languages are usually
                seen as a starting point and the stress is more on the way they are implemented and used further.
                Training on site is usually offered
                for specific company requirements, regardless of the specialisation.
            </p>
            <p> In terms of how financially rewarding the two jobs can be, that is of course a intricate equation of
                factors,
                ranging from personal abilities, to the company that offers the job. Entry-level jobs are usually
                satisfactory, if
                compared to the general market. The examples above are the median salaries, according to <a href="https://www.payscale.com">payscale.com</a>.
                A look
                somewhere else confirms the wide range of salaries. On <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm">glassdoor</a>
                [Accessed on 9<sup>th</sup> January 2019],
                the first job listed offers up to £38,000
                for front-end development, but requires knowledge of Angular, HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, Postman, Soap-UI.
                Similarly, the back-end developers are offered
                up to £50,000 for a baseline salary, provided they can develop in a variety of languages.
